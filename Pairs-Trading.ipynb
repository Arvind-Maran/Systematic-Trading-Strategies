    "## Investigating a Pairs Trading Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairs Trading is a mean reversion strategy that uses the idea that if two simillar moving stocks divert from their usual trend, they should theoretically move back to their average. There are many ways to do this, in this script we will be using the ratio between their daily percentage change to determine the mean; however, many others just use price data which is another option we can eventually test. \n",
    "\n",
    "To backtest this strategy, we will use data from the Yahoo Finance API and structure the data using Pandas. "

However, there are some things we need to take into consideration before considering this viable. \n",

In my experimentation, a larger time frame includes data points that aren't relevent enough to the present, and a shorter time frame tens to not inculde enough data to calculate an accurate enough mean. So the time frame I chose to use in this script is basically in a Goldilocks zone which is really finicky and will need to be adjusted over time.\n",

With more rigourous statistical models and more experimentation I hope to improve this script over time and make a stronger conclusion in the future. "
