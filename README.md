First Strategy (01/17/2023) : Pairs Trading - a mean reversion strategy that uses the idea that if two simillar moving stocks divert from their usual trend, they should theoretically move back to their average. There are many ways to do this, in this script we will be using the ratio between their daily percentage change to determine the mean; however, many others just use price data which is another option we can eventually test. This script is still incomplete as there are some features that can be added to increase it's accuracy and effectiveness.
